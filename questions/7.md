# Space Stone Challenge: The Cosmic Trial

## Location: The Asgard Ship

After obliterating Asgard and defeating Thor, Loki, and Hulk, Thanos sets his sights on claiming the Space Stone, which was hidden within the Tesseract. As the shattered remnants of Asgard float through the void, an ancient force halts Thanos' advance.

From the cosmic wreckage, a voice echoes—a guardian of the Tesseract’s power.

> "Power alone cannot command space. Only those who understand its flow can wield it. Before you lies the trial of the cosmos. Distortions in space create rifts—can you discern which are stable and which will collapse?"

Before Thanos, space-time pathways appear, represented as sequences of spatial coordinates (energy values). These paths fluctuate unpredictably—some are stable, while others are doomed to collapse into chaos.

Each **timeline** (a single line of the input file) consists of **energy levels** represented as a sequence of numbers. A timeline is considered **stable** if:  

1. The energy levels either **continuously increase or continuously decrease** throughout the entire timeline.  
2. The difference between any two adjacent energy levels is at least **1** and at most **3**.  

Thanos must analyze these **timelines** and determine **how many are stable**. Only then will **The Tessaract** surrender the **Space Stone**.
