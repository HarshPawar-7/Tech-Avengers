# Reality Stone Challenge: The Fractured Vision**  

## **Location: The Collector’s Vault, Knowhere**  

After claiming the **Soul Stone**, Thanos arrives at **Knowhere**, where the **Reality Stone** is kept within the vast vaults of **Taneleer Tivan, The Collector**. As he steps inside, the chamber **warps and shifts**, bending reality itself into an **unpredictable chaos of illusions**.  

The Collector appears, his voice filled with amusement.  

> *"Ah, Mad Titan, the Reality Stone is not simply taken—it must be earned. This stone reshapes existence, but only those who see through its distortions can wield it. Can you separate stability from chaos? Let’s find out."*  

Before Thanos, **fractured visions of alternate timelines** flicker into existence. Each **timeline** is a sequence of **energy levels**—raw cosmic forces that fluctuate unpredictably. Some timelines are **stable**, maintaining a structured pattern, while others are **doomed to collapse into disorder**.  

### **Hint to Solve the Challenge:**  
Each **timeline** (a single line of the input file) consists of **energy levels** represented as a sequence of numbers. A timeline is considered **stable** if:  

1. The energy levels either **continuously increase or continuously decrease** throughout the entire timeline.  
2. The difference between any two adjacent energy levels is at least **1** and at most **3**.  

Thanos must analyze these **timelines** and determine **how many are stable**. Only then will **The Collector** surrender the **Reality Stone**.

**Sample**
7 6 4 2 1: Safe because the levels are all decreasing by 1 or 2.

1 2 7 8 9: Unsafe because 2 7 is an increase of 5.
