# **Power Stone Puzzle: Cosmic Energy Surge**  

## **Location: Xandar – Nova Corps Vault**  

After claiming the **Time Stone**, Thanos sets his sights on **Xandar**, the stronghold of the **Nova Corps**, where the **Power Stone** is securely locked away. As his warships darken the skies, the Nova Corps mounts a desperate defense—but resistance is futile. The Titan's wrath is swift and absolute.  

With the Nova Corps decimated, Thanos strides into the heart of their vault, where the **Power Stone** lies within a containment chamber. As he approaches, a sudden surge of cosmic energy erupts, engulfing the room in blinding light.  

A **holographic guardian**, a remnant of Xandar’s ancient protectors, materializes before him.  

> *"Power is not merely taken, Titan—it must be **understood, measured, and mastered**. The cosmic energies before you are in turmoil. To wield the Power Stone, you must bring order to the chaos."*  

The projection swirls violently, waiting for Thanos to impose his will. Within the storm of cosmic digits, he must:  

1. **Identify the smallest and largest values** in the chaotic surge of numbers.  
2. **Compute their product** to reveal their combined might.  
3. **Find their ratio**, rounded to **two decimal places**, to measure the limits of cosmic balance.  
4. **Determine the median energy value**, representing the perfect equilibrium of power.  

Only by revealing these sacred values will the vault unlock and grant him access to the **Power Stone**.  

**Enter your answer in this format: (smallest, largest, product, ratio, median)**
