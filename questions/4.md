# Power Stone Puzzle: Cosmic Energy Surge

## Location: Temple on Morag

After claiming the **Time Stone**, Thanos arrives on **Morag**, where the ancient **Temple of Power** looms in silence. As he steps forward, the ground trembles, and a chaotic storm of flickering numbers and cryptic symbols fills the chamber.  

A holographic guardian emerges, its glowing eyes locking onto him.  

> "Power is not merely taken, Titanâ€”it must be **understood, measured, and mastered**. Before you lies raw cosmic energy in chaotic form. Extract its essence, find its extremes, and harness the balance between them."  

The projection swirls violently, waiting for Thanos to impose his will. Within the storm of cosmic digits, he must **identify the smallest and largest values**, then **unleash their combined might** by computing their **product**. To prove his mastery, he must also **test the limits of cosmic balance**, dividing the largest by the smallest, precise to two decimal places.  

Only by revealing these sacred values will the temple grant him passage to the **Power Stone**.
