# Ego Stone Challenge: The Vanishing Spell  

## **Scene Setup: The Shattered Ego**  

After gathering the six Infinity Stones, **Thanos** is trapped in a fractured dimension—his **shattered ego** manifesting around him. At its center stands an **ancient obelisk**, inscribed with a **forgotten spell**.  

A whisper echoes:  

> _"Power alone cannot wield the Ego Stone. Reconstruct the essence of self to command its might."_  

---

## **The Challenge**  

The obelisk’s inscriptions hold the **vanishing spell**, but only specific lines reveal its power—those where the **line number is a perfect square** (e.g., 1, 4, 9, ...).  

For each such line, the **spell word** is the word at the position equal to the line number.  

To claim the **Ego Stone**, Thanos must:  
1. **Identify the spell words** from the perfect square lines.  
2. **Reconstruct the forgotten spell** in order.  

Only by speaking the true spell can he restore his shattered ego and wield the **Ego Stone**.
