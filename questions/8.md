# **Mind Stone Challenge: The Final Stand**  

## **Location: The Battle of Wakanda**  

After gathering five Infinity Stones, **Thanos** arrives in **Wakanda**, where the final stone—the **Mind Stone**—rests within **Vision's forehead**. The **Avengers stand their ground**, but one by one, they fall before the Mad Titan’s might.  

As Thanos approaches Vision, 

Vision cries:  

> _"Power alone cannot command the Mind Stone. Only by unraveling the mind’s essence can one wield its true power."_  

---

## **The Challenge**  

The artifact’s inscriptions hold the **ancient incantation**, but only specific lines reveal its power—those where the **line number is a perfect square** (e.g., 1, 4, 9, ...).  

For each such line, the **incantation word** is the word at the position equal to the line number.  

To claim the **Mind Stone**, Thanos must:  
1. **Identify the incantation words** from the perfect square lines.  
2. **Reconstruct the ancient incantation** in order.  

Only by speaking the true words can he fully harness the power of the **Mind Stone**.
