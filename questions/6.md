# Soul Stone Challenge: The Memory Rift Puzzle
## Location: Cliffs of Vormir
On the forsaken cliffs of Vormir, Thanos faces Red Skull, the spectral guardian of the Soul Stone. The air is thick with echoes of lost souls, their memories entwined in an unseen force.

"The Soul Stone demands sacrifice, but it also demands understanding," Red Skull intones. "To claim its power, you must decipher the ties that bind existence itself."

Before Thanos, a spectral memory log flickers into existence, revealing a web of souls connected by unseen bonds. Each link pulsates with a strength, measured in unfathomable cosmic energy.

To prove his worth, Thanos must:

Extract the connections between souls from the log.
Identify the strongest bond, the one that holds the deepest meaning.
Declare the two souls whose connection is the most powerful.
