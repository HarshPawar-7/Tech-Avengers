# **Thanos and the Trial of the Celestial Time Stone**  

## **Location: Titan**  
The ruined landscape of **Titan** trembles under the weight of battle. The clash of energy blasts, spells, and brute strength has left deep scars on the planet’s surface. **Iron Man, Doctor Strange, Spider-Man, and Star-Lord** stand as the last line of defense, their bodies battered, their breath heavy—but they refuse to yield.  

Thanos, towering and relentless, wipes a trickle of blood from his lip—their resistance was formidable, but ultimately futile. With a final, crushing blow, he overpowers them one by one. **Doctor Strange, realizing defeat is inevitable, surrenders the Time Stone**, his fingers trembling as he levitates the glowing artifact toward Thanos.  

As Thanos grasps the **Time Stone**, the very fabric of reality around him quivers. Suddenly, the stone glows brighter, and an ancient **Celestial Computer** materializes before him, its holographic screen flickering erratically. Strange symbols dance across its surface, a chaotic cascade of shifting numbers and cryptic inscriptions.  

A spectral voice—perhaps the remnant of an ancient being—echoes through the void:  

> **"Time fractures as celestial clocks drift apart. The universe spirals into chaos unless harmony is restored. If you seek to wield the Time Stone’s full power, you must mend the rift—find the moment when all timepieces align as one."**  

Thanos steps closer, his gaze fixed upon the screen. The computer is processing vast temporal logs, each entry detailing the **reset intervals of clocks** scattered across countless dimensions. These **dimensional clocks do not tick in unison**; each follows its own cycle, resetting after a specific interval.  

To claim the **Time Stone’s true power**, Thanos must decipher the logs, extract the reset intervals of all clocks, and determine the **first moment in time when all of them reset together**. This means computing the **Least Common Multiple (LCM)** of these intervals—the earliest point where all clocks are perfectly synchronized.  

<!-- ## **The Task**  
1. **Extract the reset intervals** from the log file.  
2. **Compute the Least Common Multiple (LCM)** of all the given intervals.  
3. **Enter the correct moment into the Celestial Computer** to stabilize the timestream.   -->

Failure to do so would leave the timeline in disarray, forever fractured, with the past, present, and future spiraling into oblivion. The Time Stone is now his—but only if he can master the **mathematics of time itself**.  

  
**Can Thanos find the precise moment when all clocks align and seize control over time itself?**
