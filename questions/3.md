# Time Stone Challenge: The Temporal Log Puzzle

In the heart of the Sanctum Sanctorum, Thanos encounters an ancient celestial computer, its screen flickering with chaotic sequences. A spectral voice echoes:

"Time unravels as celestial clocks drift apart. To wield the Time Stone, you must restore balance—find the moment when all clocks align."

Before him, the temporal logs list the reset intervals of clocks scattered across dimensions. The task is clear:

Extract the reset intervals from the log file.
Compute the Least Common Multiple (LCM)—the first moment when all clocks synchronize.
Input the result to stabilize the timestream and claim the Time Stone.
