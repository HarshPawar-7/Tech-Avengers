# **The Beginning: A Whisper of Power**  

## **Location: The Sanctuary II, Deep Space**  

As the dark void of space stretches endlessly around **Sanctuary II**, the mighty warship of **Thanos**, a cloaked figure kneels before the throne. The air hums with a cold reverence as **Ebony Maw**, Thanos' most devoted follower, raises his head and speaks with a voice as smooth as silk.  

> "My Lord, power is but a whisper in the cosmos, lost in the echoes of the weak. But true dominion lies not in might aloneâ€”it is hidden within a riddle, a truth only the worthy may grasp."  

Thanos narrows his gaze, intrigued. Ebony Maw steps forward, the shadows wrapping around him as he utters a cryptic verse:  

> _"Six yet one, scattered yet whole,_  
> _Bound by fate, a destiny foretold._  
> _In time and space, in soul and mind,_  
> _In power untamed, their paths aligned._  
> _What is the key to all you desire?_"_  

A deep silence follows as the Mad Titan contemplates the riddle. His fingers tighten, his eyes burning with understanding.
