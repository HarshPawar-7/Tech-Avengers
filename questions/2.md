# **Infinity Gauntlet Challenge: The First Trial**  

Before Thanos embarks on his conquest for the **Infinity Stones**, he seeks the ultimate weapon—the **Infinity Gauntlet**. He arrives on the planet of the **Dwarves**, where the legendary gauntlet was forged. However, the forge is silent, and an ancient tablet lies before him, inscribed with a cryptic riddle. As he gazes upon it, a voice echoes: _"Power alone is meaningless without clarity. Find the one that stands apart, and the path to your destiny shall be revealed."_ The tablet contains **lines of ancient text**, each consisting of multiple **words**. Every word in the tablet is a **palindrome**—a word that reads the same forward and backward—except for **one word** that **breaks the pattern**. To claim his **Infinity Gauntlet**, Thanos must **identify the word that is NOT a palindrome and speak its name to reveal the path forward**. The only word that defies symmetry, the one that does not reflect itself, is the answer to the challenge.
