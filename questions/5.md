# Reality Stone Challenge: Artifact Rift Puzzle

## Location: Knowhere, The Collector’s Vault

After securing the **Power Stone**, Thanos arrives at **Knowhere**, where the **Reality Stone** lies within the vault of the Collector. As he steps inside, the environment distorts—reality itself bends and shifts around him. Objects flicker between states of existence, artifacts morph, and illusions blend with reality.

From the shifting shadows, the Collector's voice echoes:  

> "The Reality Stone reveals **truth and deception alike**, Titan. To wield its power, you must **discern what is real and what is illusion**. Among the artifacts in this vault, hidden truths lie. Find them, and you may grasp the stone. Fail, and you will be lost in the rift of altered reality."

Before Thanos, a collection of ancient inscriptions materializes—each sequence holds **hidden artifacts**, but deception lurks within. Each inscription is split into two distorted halves, some artifacts appear duplicated, yet only one holds **true power** in both halves. 

To prove his worth, Thanos must:
- Extract the artifacts hidden within each inscription.
- Identify the **single artifact** that appears **in both halves of each inscription**.
- Use the **priority system**, where **lowercase artifacts (a-z) have values from 1 to 26** and **uppercase artifacts (A-Z) have values from 27 to 52**.
- Calculate the **total power sum** by summing the values of all identified artifacts.

Only by proving his ability to distinguish truth from illusion will the vault relinquish the **Reality Stone**.
