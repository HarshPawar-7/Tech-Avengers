# **Reality Stone Challenge: Artifact Rift Puzzle**  

## **Location: Knowhere, The Collector’s Vault**  

After securing the **Power Stone**, Thanos arrives at **Knowhere**, where the **Reality Stone** lies within the vault of the Collector. As he steps inside, reality distorts—shifting and warping in unpredictable ways. Objects flicker between existence and illusion, and ancient artifacts transform before his eyes. The Collector’s voice echoes through the vault, laced with amusement and challenge:  

> *"The Reality Stone bends the nature of existence itself, Titan. Power is an illusion, yet even illusions have a strongest essence. Seek it, and the stone may reveal itself to you."*  

Before Thanos, inscriptions of unknown origin shimmer into existence, each holding fragments of power. Among them, certain artifacts stand above the rest—each symbol bearing a unique energy. In this domain, lowercase artifacts (‘a’-‘z’) hold values from **1 to 26**, while uppercase artifacts (‘A’-‘Z’) range from **27 to 52**. Within every inscription, one artifact radiates the greatest force, its value surpassing all others. To command the Reality Stone, Thanos must channel the energy of these dominant artifacts, summoning their combined essence to unlock the vault’s final secret.
